# responsive-images

This is my presentation deck from [CASCADE BOS meet up @Bocoup](http://www.meetup.com/cascadebos/events/225309830/) on September 22, 2015

This repo also serves as a place for grunt-responsive-image task. 

Just stick your images in `img-src` folder then run `npm install` then `grunt`

Your processed image should appear inside `/dist`

Good luck!
