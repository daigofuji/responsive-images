# responsive-images

This is my presentation deck from [CASCADE BOS meet up @Bocoup](http://www.meetup.com/cascadebos/events/225309830/) on September 22, 2015

You can view it here: [http://daigofuji.github.io/responsive-images/#1](http://daigofuji.github.io/responsive-images/#1)

This repo also serves as a place for [grunt-responsive-image](http://www.andismith.com/grunt-responsive-images/). For more info see linkes from towards the end of my slidedeck.  

Put your images in `img-src` folder, run `npm install` then `grunt`

Your processed image should appear inside `/dist`

Good luck!
